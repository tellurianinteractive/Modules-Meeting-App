## Developer opportunities
Contribute to the development of The Module Meeting App. It is open source!

Develop against the [open Web API](../../wiki/API-Guidelines).
Through the API, you can get the status of the clock and start and stop the clock from any other application.
This makes integration of existing applications and devices easy.

Also note that when run locally, the **Module Meeting App Server** supports MR-Clock polling and broadcasting protocols over TCP. 
This means that clock clients using MR-Clock protocol can connect directly to the **Module Meeting App Server** to obtaing the time.
See [Installation Manual](../../wiki/Local-Installation) how to install the app locally.

## Environment
The **Module Meeting App Server** can run on the [these operating systems](https://github.com/dotnet/core/blob/master/release-notes/5.0/5.0-supported-os.md).

The **Module Meeting App Client** can run in any modern browser that supports [Web Assembly](https://webassembly.org/). 
This includes Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge on desktop computers and mobile devices. 
It also runs in Chromium on Raspberry Pi OS.

The **Module Meeting App Client** is hosted by the **Module Meeting App Server** and automatically gets downloaded to your device
when you surf to the server endpoint. Because it is a progressive app, you can choose to install it as 
an offline app with an icon on your desktop or home screen. Or just run it as a a normal *single page* web application.
