## Quick Start
Here's how to get started!

### Is this text in your preferred language?
Good. 
If not, you can select your language by settings your preferred language in your web browser.
Then, reload the app in your web broswer.

### Where is the clock?
There are always the *Demo* clock to play with. 
But the *Demo* clock is not used at meetings.

The administrator has usually set up a specific clock for the meeting. 
1. Ask the administrator for the clock *name* and optionally the *user password*.
2. Select *Settings* in the menu, and enter this information, and click *Save*.
3. Select *Clock* in the menu and you will see the meeting clock. 

### Using the clock
You can easy see the status of the clock:
* **Red time**: Clock is stopped, and maybe there also is displayed a reason for it.
* **Green time**: Clock is running. Click *Show more* to see details.
* **Blue time**: Clock is displaying real time and the game is interrupted for some reason.

Sometimes the clock also displays a *weekday*, which may have meaning when to run the trains.
