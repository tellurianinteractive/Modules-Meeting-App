To use a clock, simply select it in the *Settings* page and save.
Registration of name and password is only necessary if you want to stop and start the clock from your app. 

Username can be your personal name or your station name.
Also register a password if the administrator permits this to stop and start the clock.

In order to manage all clock settings, both a username and the *administrator password* of the selected clock must be entered.

Registration data is stored locally on your device and will be sent to the server to display who stopped the clock and the reason why. No data is stored on the server.
