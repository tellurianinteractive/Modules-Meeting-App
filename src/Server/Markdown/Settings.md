Registration is necessary if you want to stop and start the clock from your app. Otherwise don't bother.

If your device is stationary at a station, register your station name; otherwise register with a personal name known to the participants at the meeting.

Also register a password if the administrator requires this to stop and start the clock.

In order to manage the clock settings, both your personal name and the master password of the clock must be registered.

Registration data is stored locally on your device and will be sent to the server to display who stopped the clock and the reason why. No data is stored on the server.
